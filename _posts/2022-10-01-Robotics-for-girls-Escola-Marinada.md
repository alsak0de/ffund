# Robotics for girls successfully launched at Escola Marinada in Montornés del Vallès

The robotics-for-girls' program by Scientia has been successfully launched at Escola Marinada in
Montornés del Vallès. The little Codey Robots have been received with enthusiasm and curiosity in
equal parts by the 8-9 year old girls who engaged in the course, which will be proposing 1-hour challenges in
computational thinking following a no-code icon-based approach. See below some quotes (in Catalan)
and pictures from the students.

Translated quotes:

- _I did not expect such a cool STEAM course this year!_
- _Is the class over already? When are we seeing the Codey Rockeys again?_
- _I told my mom that I want one. It has made us think very hard!_
