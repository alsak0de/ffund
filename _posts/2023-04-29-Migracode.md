# FriquiFund organizes a few-to-many session with MigraCode students 

Four members of FriquiFund, Magda, Enric, Anna and David, have participated in a “few-to-many” session with some MigraCode students. FriquiFund shared some tips on how to have a successful first interview with recent graduates from their web development program. After that, FriquiFund members acted as a recruiter so the students could practice what they just learnt in a mock environment.

MigraCode students will participate in a JobVersity very soon, so learning how to maximize their impact in a first interview at this moment is key.

Feedback from the session from both parts has been great and energizes the organizers to keep exploring more opportunities like that in the future.
