# Robotics for girls successfully launched at Escola Aur贸 in Terrassa


The robotics-for-girls' program by Scientia has been successfully launched at Escola Aur贸 in Terrassa.
The little Codey Robots have attracted girls in the school to programming and robots, empowering them
in tech and beyond. Students will tackle 1-hour challenges in computational thinking following a
no-code icon-based approach.

From the school: _We are very happy to be able to carry out this project in our school. We believe that_
_giving girls the opportunity to have a unique space to learn to code empowers them and makes them_
_feel more confident about themselves. We rate the project very positively, as it breaks stereotypes and_
_ensures equal opportunities for access to new technologies._

From the girls: _We too can do things with the PC's!_
