# Friquifund celebrates its Q4 2022 plenary session and meets robotics teacher to learn first-hand on learnings and insights

Friquifund celebrated its Q4 2022 plenary session on Dec 1st to update its members on performance, meet a partner NGO and discuss new initiatives. 

On this occasion we reviewed in detail our collaboration with <a href="https://scientia.es" target="_blank">Scientia</a> in offering robotics for girls (and boys!) to high-complexity schools. 
Friquifund is piloting a robotics program using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzSEg4iR9e0" target="_blank">Codey Rocky robots</a> in two schools, one in 
Montornès del Vallès and on in Terrassa. Overall 100+ students face weekly challenges to develop their computational thinking with its cute robots and icon-based programming interface.
Tonyi Piñero, the teacher leading the program in Escola Marinada (Montornès del Vallès), shared her views on the program and was enthusiastic on how
her students are making progress, especially girls. She praised the course design, that starts with problem solving and ends with programming, allowing for flexible solutions.
She shared that her students cannot wait until the next challenge is up and reported that girls are making the most out of it, empowering them in technology.  

We shared the good progress on the mentoring program, the new website and social media sites (Linkedin and Twitter).

We also shared two new initiatives that will be launched in the coming months: (1) professional orientation for tech high schools in underprivileged neighborhoods 
and (2) scholarships in tech schools for a vulnerable students. Stay tuned for more news!
