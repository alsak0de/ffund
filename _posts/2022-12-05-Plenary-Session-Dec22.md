# FriquiFund celebrates its Q4 2022 plenary session and meets robotics teacher to get first-hand learnings and insights

FriquiFund celebrated its Q4 2022 plenary session on Dec 1st to update its members on performance, meet a partner NGO and discuss new initiatives.

On this occasion we reviewed in detail our collaboration with <a href="https://scientia.es" target="_blank">Scientia</a> in offering robotics for girls (and boys!) to high-complexity schools.
FriquiFund is piloting a robotics program using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzSEg4iR9e0" target="_blank">Codey Rocky robots</a> in two schools, one in Montornès del Vallès and one in Terrassa. Overall 100+ students face weekly challenges to develop their computational thinking with cute little robots and an icon-based programming interface.
Tonyi Piñero, the teacher leading the program at Escola Marinada (Montornès del Vallès), shared her views on the program and was enthusiastic on how her students are making progress, especially girls. She praised the course design, that starts with problem solving and ends with programming, allowing for flexible solutions.
She shared that her students cannot wait until the next challenge is up and reported that girls are making the most out of it, empowering them in technology.
