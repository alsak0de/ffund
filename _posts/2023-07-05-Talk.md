# Friquifund Talk: Responsible AI


FriquiFund Talks is a new project that invites top FriquiFund members to speak about hot topics to the general public, with all the proceedings being donated to specific NGOs or pilots projects.

Our first event in this series was on the topic of **Responsible AI: Ethics and Risks in ML**, with speakers Ariadna Font Llitjos and Ricardo Baeza-Yates. 

More than 100 people attended the talks. With your support, we were able to raise 2.050â‚¬ to help [eXplorium](https://explorium.cat/)  carry out  STEM activities for young geeks, particularly:

* 1 year of extracurricular Science activities in a high complexity school (15-20 students)
* 2  Grants for high school students to attend the eXplorium [Summer Camp](https://explorium.cat/colonies-destiu-2023)
