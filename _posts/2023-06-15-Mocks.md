# FriquiFund Mock Interviews Updates

Last Monday June 15, our fellow Friquifunder Enric Spagnolo did a presentation in [Factoria F5](https://factoriaf5.org/), describing the challenges and tips for interviewing in Software Engineering positions. 

Attendees included a group of bootcamp students in the women group mentored by Lola Mart√≠nez. 

We also took the chance to introduce our Mock Interview program, offering the skills and experience of fellow Friquifunders to simulate Interviews with students from our NGO partners.
