# FriquiFund collaborates with Fundación Esplai BITaminadas program

We are collaborating with Fundació Esplai in their BITaminades program through mentoring. Up to 6 FriquiFund members and friends have volunteered to be referees for girls with an interest in STEM to support them in their BITaminadas project. 

Such a project aims to bring girls between 12 and 17 years old closer to programming and AI. Mentors play the role of socially supporting their students by acting as a referee, sharing vital experiences, answering questions about women in tech, etc.

Our mentors will receive training and will be part of the program for a minimum of 6 months. Big kudos to Paula, Irene, Carmen, Zsofia, Maria and Elisabeth!
