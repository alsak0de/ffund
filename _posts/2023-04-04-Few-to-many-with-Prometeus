# Prometeus members and Friquifunders meet to talk about promotions in companies

Eight members of the Prometeus program of different profiles (computer science engineers, mechanical engineers, biologists...) and six friquifunders met to talk and discuss about promotions, how and when to move to another company and what were the most important skills that they valued.

The session was super interesting and productive for all of us!
