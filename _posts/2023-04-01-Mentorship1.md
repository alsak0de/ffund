# FriquiFund Mentoring scaling up!

We kicked off the FriquiFund 1-to-1 [Mentoring initiative](https://friquifund.org/efforts) in September 2022 with a pilot with 6 students from [IRES](https://www.fundacioires.org/ca/que-fem/ecosistema-de-projectes/projecte-click/). This month we started scaling up and reaching out to other NGOs... and we're already at 14 students matched with mentors!

Our mentors are  FriquiFund members voluntarily sharing their time, knowledge, and skills. During these last few months we helped 6 students to get through their studies, get their first job or a needed internship, find and pay a private tutor to help them with university courses, etc. Every student success energizes us to keep going and to scale this program broader.

There is a great appetite for this kind of program in many NGOs and it is a great way for FriquiFund members to give one of their greatest assets: their experience and knowledge.
