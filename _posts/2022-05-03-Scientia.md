# Friquifund sponsors Scientia in bringing robotics-for-girls program in schools with vulnerable students

Friquifund has agreed to launch its first collaboration with <a href="https://www.scientia.es" target="_blank">Scientia</a>, a foundation specialized in robotics
for children's programs. Scientia uses the charming Codey Rocky robots to attract children to robotics
and computational thinking, using an icon-based (no code) approach. Given the current gender gap in
technology and the overrepresentation of boys in robotics programs, Friquifund has asked Scientia to
offer this program only for girls, to ensure full exposure and empowerment, in two high-complexity
schoos in the greater Barcelona. If a girls' group is created, the same robots may be used for boys too.

Target: 50 girls, 8- to 12-year-old, with interest in robotics (and boys, if a girl's group is created)

Effort: purchase of 50 Codey Rocky robots and coaching of teachers in delivering 1-hour challenges each
week of the school year

Investment: 5,000€ (2022)
