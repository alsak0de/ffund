# FriquiFund Mock Interviews Launched

[Friquifund](https://friquifund.org/) has launched a program offering mock interviews for students in the final stages of their education. In our first session we collaborated with [Migracode](https://migracode.openculturalcenter.org/) and interviewed more than 10 students!

The idea is to provide an opportunity for students to make all the usual interview mistakes of inexperienced candidates in a safe environment where students have nothing to lose, and a lot to learn.

All the interviews are conducted by Friquifund members with proven experience in Tech, Analytics, Machine Learning... and simulate the conditions of a real interview. The format of the interviews is flexible, but generally follows proven patterns in the industry: Coding Interviews, Behavioural Interviews...
