# Our efforts

Our mission is to support young STEM students in need. This support is materialized through different actions and efforts.

## Collaboration with NGOs

FriquiFund was founded in 2019. At that time, there were and still are many well-structured organizations actively supporting young STEM students in need. We acknowledge their experience and collaborate with them through cash donations, so that they can improve or extend their support to even more people. By 2022, FriquiFund has donated {{ site.data.sitetext.total_donated }}. We are currently collaborating with the following NGOs.

1. **<a href="https://www.aeiraval.org" target="_blank">AEIRaval</a>** (Associació Educativa Integral del Raval): Support vulnerable youngsters in Raval and other neighbourhoods in BCN in pursuing studies and finding initial jobs with both sponsorship of study-related costs and coaching.

## Mentoring and Internships for young STEM students

Lots of members in FriquiFund have IT, engineering or science-related professional careers. This provides us the knowledge and workforce to run a Mentoring program to closely support young STEM students and an Internships program to help them find the right place to do internships. We started these prorgams mid 2022. By the end of 2022 we are mentoring {{ site.data.sitetext.n_mentored_students }} students. 

**Mentoring**: We guide students and help them in the process of deciding their future, finding internships and professional opportunities, applying for a job or preparing for job interviews. A mentor is assigned to the student and one-to-one sessions or calls are scheduled to discuss any topic of interest of the student. In the following links more information can be found regarding the mentoring program and how to apply for it:

## Other efforts

Thanks to our community, FriquiFund has a close relationship with Barcelona tech companies through its members. This enables us to connect students with internship opportunities, and the other way around. By the end of 2022, we have successfully organized {{ site.data.sitetext.n_connected_students }} internships in Barcelona companies.

Finally, our ambition is to provide help in any STEM-related area. Specifically, we are aware that a challenge some of the young STEM students face is not having access to IT material. In this area, we facilitate hardware donations to NGOs and students ({{ site.data.sitetext.hardware_donated }} so far).
