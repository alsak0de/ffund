# Get Involved
We are always looking for volunteers to help us grow and be able to reach more vulnerable youngsters. 
[Contact us to join the Friqui revolution!]('https://forms.gle/qvA6dyxtcm7rNTK79')

## Have recurrent availability


1. **Jobbuddies Program:** This program provides structured assistance to Migracode students as they pursue their first tech job after completing the Migracode bootcamp. It spans **8 weeks with one-hour sessions each week**, covering topics such as CV preparation, job search techniques, crafting cover letters, interview readiness, and mock interviews. The 2024 program is scheduled to begin the week of April 15th.

2. **Free-will Mentoring:** This initiative fosters organic mentorship relationships between mentors and mentees, tailored to the individual needs of the mentees. It supports a variety of objectives, from academic assistance to transitioning into STEM fields or securing initial tech industry positions.

## Looking for one-off volunteering opportunities
1. **Company Tour:** Do you want to sponsor a visit to your Company? Our mentees really appreciate visiting tech companies and getting to see first-hand how the sector works. If your company is open for external visits, we would really apprecite your help! This would require **2h to organize, plus 2h the day of the visit.**

2. **High School Talks:** This prograim aims to showcase STEM careers in high complexity schools. Usually, these sessions **-which last for 90 minutes-**involve two or more speakers, that share their careers and the work they do, in an inspiring and educational manner. If you have sparse availability and you want to showcase STEM careers to vulnerable youngsters, please join us, we are always in the look for volunteers! 

## Have flexible dedication

1. **NGO Metrics:**  we recently created a taskforce to evaluate all the different initiatives we are fostering and better measure their metrics. This is a newly created group, actively looking for volunteers interested on the intersection between data & non-profit.

2. **FriquiFund Talks:** we organize 2 fundraising talks every year.  The objective of these talks is two-fold: on one hand, it allows us to raise funds for our initiatives (speakers volunteer to give a talk at no cost, and all proceeds go to FriquiFund). On the other, it creates a place to meet for FriquiFund members, mentees, students participating in our iniatives and other interested audience, allowing us to have a common (and diverse) space to meet. We are always seeking volunteers to help organize these initiatives, find new speakers, etc. 

3. **Others:** do you want to help us communicate better, reach more members, find more NGOs or broaden our impact? Do not hesitate to contact us!
