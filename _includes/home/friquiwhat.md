On June 2019 we launched FriquiFund Barcelona with the mission of supporting budding geeks (*friquis*, in Spanish) in developing their careers.

Over the last {{ site.data.sitetext.years_operating }} years we have donated {{ site.data.sitetext.total_donated }} to {{ site.data.sitetext.n_donated_ngos }} NGOs supporting young <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics" target="_blank">STEM</a> students in need. We also run a Mentoring program, and an Internships program to help the students find the right place to do internships. We organize fundraising talks on STEM topics in order to support our cause, and we partner with local NGOs to motivate, inspire and explain STEM to underprivileged youngsters (<a href='https://friquifund.beefreecontent.com/ZFyI' target="blank">see our 2024 Year in Review</a>).

Today we are {{ site.data.team.size }} members, mainly people in the IT/Engineering/Sciences profession with a strong attachment to Barcelona (either physical or emotional...). You can see the [full list of members and corporate partners here](/about-us).

We are always looking for likeminded individuals who want to make a positive impact in the world by helping the next generation of geeks. Interested? [become a member today!](/join-us)
