On June 2019 we launched FriquiFund Barcelona with the mission of supporting budding geeks (*friquis*, in Spanish) in developing their careers.

Today we are more than 100 members and we have donated ~30,000â‚¬ to NGOs supporting young [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics) students in need.
