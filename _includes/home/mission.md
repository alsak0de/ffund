**Our Mission:** We support young underprivileged geeks in developing their careers. Geeks (Friqui in Spanish) here is understood in a very narrow sense as: “people interested in pursuing careers in STEM”. FriquiFund members are all professionals related to the STEM world, willing to donate time and money to our mission.

**Our Approch:** We support NGOs which support young underprivileged geeks: with cash donations, networking (internships, scholarships, teachers, jobs), mentoring and any other way we may think of.

**Ongoing Efforts:**

- Currently we are collaborating with four NGOs: AEIRaval, IRES, MigraCode and Scientia. Check them out in our [Efforts](efforts.html) page.
- We are running an experimental Mentorship program (with 10 students)
- We hold plenary meetings four times per year.
