**Our Mission:** FriquiFund was born with the mission to help young underprivileged geeks in developing their careers. Geeks (Friqui in Spanish) is understood in a very narrow sense as: “people interested in pursuing careers in STEM”. FriquiFund members are all professionals related to the STEM world, grateful to have had the opportunity to do what they love, and willing to donate time and money to our mission.

**Our Approach:** We support NGOs which help young underprivileged geeks: with cash donations, scolarships, networking (internships, teachers, jobs), talks, mentoring and others. We want to contribute towards the education costs of technical students in need and, beyond this, help them with our time, experience and network, help motivate them through their studies and help them land good jobs and grow into forces of change.

- We collaborate with {{ site.data.sitetext.n_donated_ngos }} NGOs: AEIRaval, IRES, MigraCode, Scientia, BarcelonaActua, eXplorium, Factoria F5 and Lutravioleta. Check them out in our [Efforts](efforts.html) page.
- We run a [Mentorship program](efforts.html).
- We organize fundraising Talks with industry-experts on STEM topics to raise money towards our mission.
- We hold plenary meetings four times per year.
