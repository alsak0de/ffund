**Our Mission:** We support young underprivileged geeks in developing their careers. Geeks (Friqui in Spanish) here is understood in a very narrow sense as: “people interested in pursuing careers in STEM”. FriquiFund members are all professionals related to the STEM world, willing to donate time and money to our mission.

**Our Approach:** We support NGOs which help young underprivileged geeks: with cash donations, scolarships, networking (internships, teachers, jobs), talks, mentoring and others.

**Ongoing Efforts:**

- We collaborate with six NGOs: AEIRaval, IRES, MigraCode, Scientia, BarcelonaActua, eXplorium and Factoria F5. Check them out in our [Efforts](efforts.html) page.
- We run a Mentorship program.
- We organize fundraising Talks with industry-experts on STEM topics to raise money towards our mission.
- We hold plenary meetings four times per year.
